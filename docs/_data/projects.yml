- name: "Sudoku Solver"
  repository: https://github.com/jbmanning/sudoku
  date: "May 2020 - Present"
  description: |-
    Designed and implemented a solver for sudoku puzzles in React.js and Mobx. Employs an array
    of well-known techniques to efficiently solve puzzles. Each technique was analyzed
    and implemented by hand to get better at studying and implementing various algorithms.
    View current work in progress build at [sudoku.jman.me](https://sudoku.jman.me).

- name: "Site Builder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*CivicPlus*"
  date: "Late 2019"
  description: |-
    User friendly, WYSIWYG site builder to provide drastically lower implementation
    costs and enable users to build fully customizable components in-browser. Proof
    of concept implemented in React.js with drag and drop containers, in-browser editable
    SCSS styles, and templated reusable components.

  repository: https://github.com/jbmanning/git-key
  date: "Dec 2016, Apr 2017, Dec 2018"
  description: |-
    Built a comprehensive script to find, generate, and upload SSH keys to
    your personal user account in GitHub. I frequently use this when setting
    up new machines and new accounts. Multiple iterations. Using Bash, Python,
    GitHub API, personal access tokens, one-time passwords, and OAuth.

- name: "Email-Handler"
  date: "June 2020"
  description: |-
    Simple API endpoint to send myself email programatically. Written in Node.js, hosted in
    AWS Lambda, and HTTP triggers in API Gateway. Email sent using Sendgrid API.

- name: "Historical weather scraper"
  date: "Late 2019"
  description: |-
    Data scraping tool built as an initial data source for a research project
    through Kansas State University. I utilized a public Taiwanese website that rendered
    graphical representations of historical monthly weather data from several
    hundred weather stations (for 15 years of data, over 140,000 individual files).
    The data source had no bulk download available and the data was rendered on the
    server-side into HTML charts. The combination of being written in a foreign language,
    having to parse and convert data out of raw HTML, and scraping 140k individual files
    made this an enjoyable project to solve. Implemented using Node.js.

- name: "Dropbox-Screenshot"
  repository: https://github.com/jbmanning/dropbox-screenshot
  date: "Late 2016"
  description: |-
    When using Linux as a daily driver I missed the Mac/Windows functionality that
    Dropbox had to have a keybinding to select a screen region, save a screenshot into
    your Dropbox, and copy a shareable URL to your clipboard. I reimplemented this
    behavior using Python, Dropbox API, and various CLI tools.

- name: "@jman.me/create-react-app"
  repository: https://github.com/jbmanning/create-react-app
  date: "May 2020"
  description: |-
    I frequently set up new projects in React for testing or development and am a fan of
    having an opinionated structure to work off of. Having a tool to consistently build
    these with the same structure and dependencies is a nice operations time saver.
    Implemented in Node.js, layered on top of the existing create-react-app tool.
    Introduces TypeScript, MobX, Prettier, a folder structure, and more. Use by
    running ```npx @jman.me/create-react-app [MyProject]```

- name: "Post-Install"
  repository: https://github.com/jbmanning/post-install
  date: "Dec 2016, Apr 2017, May 2018"
  description: |-
    When using and learning Linux I ran into a lot of ways to have conflicting dependencies
    or simply break everything. As a result, every few months I was in the habit of reinstalling
    my entire Linux partition. This project is a tool to automate the re-setup of a new machine.
    Implemented using Ansible and Python, this tool re-installed global dependencies in a consistent
    format which would ideally not conflict for any future installs. Multiple iterations over time
    adding more functionality and different install types.

- name: "Identity Platform"
  repository: https://github.com/jbmanning/auth
  date: "Early 2019, Present"
  description: |-
    This is a gigantic personal research project to study the field of authentication and
    authorization across the web. My goal is to learn about and build a compliant
    authentication and authorization implementation for Single Sign On across my website.
    I would never use this in a truly secure context, but learning about the intricacies
    of this security flow provides a lot of knowledge around how things actually work instead
    of entirely relying on libraries without knowing what they do. Initial stages of development
    performed using Golang and React.js.

- name: "Sequencing"
  repository: https://github.com/jbmanning/sequencing
  date: "Mid 2018"
  description: |-
    A colleague of mine is working on a Ph.D. in the field of Plant Pathology.
    He was curious about analyzing irregularities/patterns across a genome and had
    been manually searching through thousands of characters in word files by hand.
    We worked together to design and implement an initial mockup to parse and analyze
    genomes from .fasta files, searching for irregularities and defined
    patterns. Written in Python and React.js.

- name: "Pong"
  repository: https://github.com/jbmanning/projects/pong
  date: "Early 2019"
  description: |-
    Quick free-time project to learn about game programming algorithms such as collision
    and to implement the game of Pong using browser technologies.
