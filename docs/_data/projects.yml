    hours** of manual data cleaning.

- name: "Historical weather scraper"
  date: "Late 2019"
  tech: Node.js
  description: |-
    Data scraping tool built as an initial data source for a research project
    through Kansas State University. I utilized a public Taiwanese website that rendered
    graphical representations of historical monthly weather data from several
    hundred weather stations (for 15 years of data, over 140,000 individual files).
    The data source had no bulk download available and the data was rendered on the
    server-side into HTML charts. The combination of being written in a foreign language,
    having to parse and convert data out of raw graph nodes, and scraping 140k individual files
    made this an enjoyable project to solve.

    This is a gigantic personal research project to study the field of authentication and
    authorization across the web. My goal is to learn about and build a compliant implementation

    of the security flow provides a lot of insight into how things work.
