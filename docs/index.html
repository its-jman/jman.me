  Hi! I'm Josh (he/him).
</p>

<p>
  I am an Ultimate Frisbee player, Software Engineer, and a work-in-progress cook. (I'm a picky eater, but
  if you have any recipes you're in love with, send them my way! I'll see if I can try them out.)
  Right now I am working as a Software Developer at AutoAlert.
</p>

<!--<p>
  I am compassionate about the experience of those who use sofware I develop, as well as the devlopers
  who I work alongside. If I can put those people into a position where they are able to do their
  jobs more effictively and more efficiently, I feel that I have succeeded in that day. I enjoy
  working between technical and non-technical team members and clients to communicate goals, ideas,
  and blockers in an effective manner. Oftentimes people ask about the technical requirements of a
  project and stop there, I strive to work with them to uncover their underlying goals and
  potentially design a solution to help solve those goals.
