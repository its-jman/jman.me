  Hi! I'm Josh (he/him).
</p>

<p>
  I am an Ultimate Frisbee player, Software Engineer, and I am working on my cooking skills.
  (If you have any recipes you're in love with, send them my way! I'll see if I can try them out.)
  I am currently employed as a Software Developer at AutoAlert in Kansas City.
</p>

<p>
  Myself, I am compassionate about the experience of those around me, whether that is customers who use the
  sofware I develop, developers I work alongside, or even players and teamates that I compete with in ultimate 
  frisbee. My goal is to empower these people every day, whether that means helping them learn about new concept, building 
  software to streamline a process, or even working with them to find a way to analyze their data more effectively. 
</p>

<p>
  I'd love to hear from you, please feel free to reach out anytime!
