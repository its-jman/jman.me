  Hi! My name is Josh Manning.
</div>

<div class="p">
  I am a Software Engineer at Meta. My experience has been primarily on the front end but I've also spent a lot of time working on my own projects, bouncing around a lot of different languages and technologies.
</div>

<div class="p">
  Outside of any particular tech stack, I love learning, teaching, and building clean, automated experiences for those around me. On a more personal level outside of coding, I also travel around the country competing on an Ultimate Frisbee team. I've spent a lot of time around Kansas City, but am currently based out of the Bay Area, CA.
