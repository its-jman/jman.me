  Hi! I'm Josh (he/him).
</p>

<p>
  I am an Ultimate Frisbee player, Software Engineer, and I am working on my cooking skills.
  (If you have any recipes you're in love with, send them my way! I'll see if I can try them out.)
  I am currently employed as a Software Developer at AutoAlert.
</p>

<p>
  I am compassionate about the experience of those who use the sofware I develop, as well as the devlopers
  who I work alongside. If I can put those people into a position where they are able to do their
  jobs more effectively and more efficiently, I feel that I have succeeded in that day.
