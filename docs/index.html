  Hi! My name is Josh Manning.
</div>

<div class="p">
  I am a Front-End Engineer at Amazon. To give you some background on myself, I have been around computers my whole life. My dad introduced me to Visual Basic early on, and I got started professionally back in high school when one of my professors offered me a job.
</div>

<div class="p">
  My experience has been primarily on the front end but I've also spent a lot of time working on my own projects, bouncing around a lot of different languages and technologies.
</div>

<div class="p">
  Outside of any particular tech stack, I love teaching, and I love building clean, automated experiences for those around me. For instance, in conjunction with helping to train the design team to build their own websites, I ended up automated myself out of the work I was hired to do at one of my old jobs.
</div>

<div class="p">
  On a more personal level, outside of coding, I also travel around the country competing on an Ultimate Frisbee team. I'm currently based out of Kansas and will be moving to Arlington, VA at some point when we are back in the office.
</div>

<div class="p">
  I'd love to hear from you, please feel free to reach out anytime!
