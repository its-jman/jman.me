  Hi! I'm Josh (he/him).
</div>

<div class="p">
  I am an Ultimate Frisbee player, Software Engineer, and I am working on my cooking skills.
  (If you have any recipes you're in love with, send them my way! I'll see if I can try them out.)
  I work as a Front End Enginner at Amazon (Arlington, VA).
</div>

<div class="p">
  I am compassionate about the experience of those around me, whether that is customers who use the
  software I develop, developers I work alongside, or even players and teammates that I compete with in ultimate
  frisbee. My goal is to empower these people every day, whether that means helping them learn a new concept,
  working with them to help achieve a new project or goal, or even building software to help streamline a process of theirs.

<div class="p">
  I'd love to hear from you, please feel free to reach out anytime!
