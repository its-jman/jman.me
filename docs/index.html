  Hi! My name is Josh Manning.
</div>

<div class="p">
  I am a Front-End Engineer at Amazon. My experience has been primarily on the front end but I've also spent a lot of time working on my own projects, bouncing around a lot of different languages and technologies.
</div>

<div class="p">
  Outside of any particular tech stack, I love learning, teaching, and building clean, automated experiences for those around me. On a more personal level outside of coding, I also travel around the country competing on an Ultimate Frisbee team. I'm currently based out of Kansas and will be moving to Arlington, VA at some point when we are back in the office.
</div>

<div class="p">
  I'd love to hear from you, please feel free to reach out anytime!
